I specialize in helping couples re-establish safety, connection & communication. I utilize Attachement theory, Emotionally Focused therapy & Imago therapy approaches to partnership. I teach couples how to communicate compassionately, conflict productively & maintain connection through periods of discord. I show you how to stay embodied and regulated while facing fears and difficult emotions. A healthy, thriving partnership is flexible, attuned & adaptive, utilizing healthy interpseronal boundaries to create safety. I guide, teach and encourage you with kind, gentle reflections, on how to continually evolve your relationship. Email or call today with questions healing@wizetherapy.com 510&#8209;301&#8209;7655
