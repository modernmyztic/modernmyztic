I offer consultation sessions for clinical practitioners over the phone and video chat. These can be scheduled in 1, 1.5 or 2 hour blocks, typically once a month. I deeply enjoy guiding and supporting my respected colleagues as much as I benefit from their support and wizdom. I provide a safe, non-judgmental, learning environment that thrives on a combination of praise and challenge. I encourage you to trust your skills, education and most of all, your intuition. You're in this field for a reason and you are full of creative solutions and insights. I help you discover your own, unique interventions while offering complimentary material to consider. I maintain a clear grasp of law and ethics and take pride in setting a standard of integrity for our work. I offer a reduced rate for clinicians in their first and second years of business.
