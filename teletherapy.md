Teletherapy (Online Therapy & Counseling) is an easy, flexible and efficient way of participating in therapy using your phone, computer or tablet.  Online Counseling allows us to connect in real time over the phone, email or video chat. Teletherapy provides convenience and consistency that traditional, in-person therapy cannot offer. And, you enjoy the benefits of high-quality therapy from the comfort of your own home. Teletherapy is appropriate for anyone who seeks support in changing problematic aspects of their inner or outer life and is effective at addressing everything that in-person therapy addresses. I'm glad to answer any questions you may have about Teletherapy. Email healing@wizetherapy.com or call 510&#8209;301&#8209;7655
