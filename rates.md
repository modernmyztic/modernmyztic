My fee is $200 for 50 minutes of Individual Therapy. My fee is $250 for 50 minutes of Couples Counseling. I offer a sliding scale for those who qualify. My services may be covered in full or in part by your health insurance or employee benefit plan. Please check your coverage carefully by asking your insurance company the following questions:  Do I have mental health insurance benefits? What is my deductible and has it been met? How many sessions per year does my health insurance cover? What is the coverage amount per therapy session? Is approval required from my primary care physician? I will gladly provide you a receipt that you can submit to your insurance company for reimbursement.<p/><p/>Cancellation policy: You must notify me 24 hours in advance that you’d like to reschedule your session via email or voice mail. If you do not notify me in advance and do not ‘show up’ to our scheduled appointment, you will be responsible for the full cost of the session.
