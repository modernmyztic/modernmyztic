I specialize in the unique complexities of Womanhood. Women, as a culture, face distinct challenges with body-image, sexuality, infertility, pregnancy, motherhood, friendship, partnership, work, leadership, menopause and retirement. Women have been conditioned to suffer silently in solitude and therefore have the added challenge of finding a safe place to reflect, heal and empower. As a woman healer, I am sensitive to these needs and take extra care and consideration in creating safety, listening deeply, and maintaining an open, accepting, judgment-free atmosphere. I'm trained as a Doula which provides me with insight and special skills relating to family planning, fertility issues, difficult pregnancies, postpartum depression, motherhood, and partnership post baby.
