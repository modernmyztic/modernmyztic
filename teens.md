After working with adolescents for several years, I have enormous respect for the delicacies of this stage of life. Most teenagers are striking a balance between managing stress/anxiety effectively while preserving and continuing to build healthy self-confidence. With guidance and practice, adolescents can develop healthy coping skills that will set them up for success as adults. Without support and guidance, teens often turn to self-destructive behaviors that become more difficult to unlearn over time. I've helped teens address social/peer issues, divorce, self-harm behaviors, substance use, eating disorders, etc..
