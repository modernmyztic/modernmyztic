As a child, I was intrigued with the metaphysical: angels, aliens, sacred spaces, ghosts, haunted houses, etc.. I was a sensitive & empathetic observer of the world. I could sense distress is others instantly. I often felt compelled to use my awareness as a tool of support, reaching out to offer warmth. I learned how to read energy, channel guidance and wizdom & soothe the people around me effortlessly.

In college, I studied World Religions and Gender Studies. I focused on the big questions: Who am I? What is this world? What's my purpose? What's the meaning of it all? I found myself drawn to Myzticism which I discovered is one of the only universal aspects of all religions. Every religion has their Myztics who claim to experience direct contact with the Divine. I resonated with this concept and set out to experience the Divine personally & directly.

I began meditating & exploring Buddhism & Hinduism. I worked with Ken Wilber at the Integral Institute, examining every aspect of human evolution. I studied & meditated & philosophized & meditated & wrote essays & meditated. Eventually, I rejected this overly intellectual approach to Enlightenment.

I graduated college and left the United States. I lived in Spain for a year and traveled extensively, learning how to ground & embody the wizdom life was offering me. After a period of wild wandering, I found my way to the Bay Area, CA.

I worked odd jobs until I was guided to pursue Integral Counseling Psychology at the California Institute of Integral Studies (CIIS) in San Francisco. I appreciated that CIIS infused Spirituality with every aspect of Psychology that I learned. I have been working as a Licensed Transpersonal Psychotherapist for over 10 years, learning about healing & wholeness.

It's only been in recent years that I began to distinguish a difference between the skills I acquired in school & my natural abilities to empathize & channel. I often experience 'downloads' of information while working with my clients and realized that often the guidance I offer is not coming from me at all. This is when I accepted that I'm a Psychic Clarvoyant.

I began reading books, taking classes & practicing my skills whenever I can. I now offer services both as a Psychotherapist and a Psychic Clarvoyant. I've discovered that when we feel connected to Spirit, we heal better and thrive more. I've also learned healhty boundaries & the essential importance of Trust in living a spiritual life. I'm contantly exploring the balance of spiritual practice, family life & professional work.

I've dedicated my professional life to helping people tap into the infinite reservoir of Love, support & protection that is available at all times. We cannot navigate this life alone & we're not meant to. Clearly you're ready to dive into your Spiritual wellspring too or you wouldn't be reading this right now....
