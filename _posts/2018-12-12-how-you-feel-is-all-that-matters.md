Emotions are literally the MOST IMPORTANT things in existence. In a sense, they are the only experiences that matter. Everything you do and want is because you believe that in the doing or having of it…you will FEEL better. That is all anyone is ever after. We just want to feel good. As often as possible.

We’ve come up with infinite ways of glorifying pain and suffering to make them more acceptable when they’re inescapable. We shame ourselves for wanting more and train ourselves to settle for less. There are empires, institutions & religions built on suppressing emotion. Don’t be fooled. Your true agenda is to feel good, as much of the time as possible. People with addictions are just trying to feel better. People get angry and hateful because it feels better than sadness, depression or numbness. People complete suicide because they want to feel better and experience relief. The most heinous of acts are done to achieve a better feeling. You may want more money, a new car, a different lover, a new job, a bigger house, a nice watch, more Instagram likes…whatever you want is because you think you feel better in the having of it!

Feelings aren’t only the motivation for everything we do; they are the roadmap for our lives. Well, maybe more like the control panel. When you feel negative emotion, you are not living according to your values. When you feel positive emotion, you are. It’s actually that simple! If you are considering accepting a new job offer and as you imagine what it will feel like to be in that position, you feel pleasant, satisfying feelings, you should take it. If you imagine being in the new position and you feel fear, doubt, anxiety, stress, confusion, etc. you should not take the job. If people could get out of their heads and listen to their emotions, they would feel so much better so much of the time, which is what we’re all after anyway! It’s thoughts and outside influences that deter the whole journey.

Emotions live in the body. When you feel anger, does your face get hot and red? Does your chest begin to tingle and tighten? Do your fists clench and your jaw clamp? When you need to know how you feel to make the best choice, check in with the body and listen. Your emotions will tell you exactly what to do. Do the things that make you feel good. Don’t do the things that make you feel bad. When you have thoughts that provoke unpleasant feelings, force yourself to think about something else. Do it over and over and over until your thoughts cooperate with your will. Choose satisfying thoughts and feelings and you will feel good. Now you are winning at life.
